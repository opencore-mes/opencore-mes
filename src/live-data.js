// Live data a component shows and keeps current, whose arguments come from the route.
//
// `api.live(path, service, ...args)` writes a live query's answer to a state path and keeps it
// there. A page that uses it by hand has three things to get right, and each one fails quietly:
//
//   The arguments move. RouterView keeps a page's instance when only the route's params or query
//   change (the next page of a list, another item under /things/:id), so nothing re-runs on its own.
//   The helpers here read the arguments INSIDE the getter they return, which is what subscribes the
//   page to them: the subscription moves when they change, and only then.
//
//   The arguments are the preload's. A server render answers a call only from what the route
//   preloaded (requirePreload refuses any other), and a call is keyed by the JSON of its arguments,
//   so the arguments built here must be the route's `preload` entry's, argument for argument:
//   `list()` and `list({})` are two different calls, and the second fails on the server alone.
//
//   The old subscription is dropped only AFTER the new one exists, so a change that arrives
//   mid-swap is not lost. Between a navigation and the answer, the previous data stays on screen
//   rather than the page emptying and jumping, and the getter's `state()` says "pending" meanwhile
//   (api.liveState, juris.js): the data shown is the last route's, and a page that must not pass it
//   off as this one's reads that. It used to be shown under the new route with no mark at all, and
//   for good when the new answer never came (a refused subscribe, a failed re-run).
//
// And one path, one service. A path written by one service and read by a component that expects
// another's answer is a page drawing the wrong data, and only after a navigation between two pages
// that share it, so a reload hides it. `claimPath` refuses a second service on a path, and every
// helper here claims the path it writes.
//
// It imports nothing: browsers download it, and a server render runs it.

// ---- one path, one service ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// The rule is one-way on purpose: a path may not be claimed by two different SERVICES, but one
// service may write to several paths (the same service asked two questions, under two paths).
//
// A claim is the instance's: its pages are what share the paths, and a server renders every request
// with one. So another instance in the same process (a test's, another app's) starts with none, and
// a claim made on a server holds for every later request it renders. The registry is found through
// the component's api by the instance's own `live`: the api object is replaced whenever a plugin
// adds to it (juris.use), and each of its functions is made once per instance and carried over, so
// `live`, whose paths these are, names the instance for as long as it lives. A second copy of this
// module (the same file under two addresses, during a deploy) keeps its own registry.
