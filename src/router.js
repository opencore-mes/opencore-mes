// State-based router for Juris. The route is state under `$route` (routePath option):

//   $route.path      "/lots/L1"          raw state: writing it IS navigation
//   $route.query     { filter: "done" }  raw state: writing it updates the URL
//   $route.hash      "top"               raw state
//   $route.name      "lot"               derived from path + route table (leaf-level writes, so a
//   $route.params    { id: "L1" }        reader of $route.params.id wakes only when the id changes)
//   $route.matched   [0, 3]              derived: indices into router.records, outermost first
//   $route.meta      { ... }             derived: merged meta of the matched chain
//
// Install: juris.use(createRouter({ routes, mode, base }))  →  api.navigate, api.link, api.isActive,
// api.route, api.router; components RouterView and Link. On the client the URL follows the state
// (pushState / replaceState) and popstate writes back; on the server nothing touches a location —
// router.resolve(url) gives the state, the preload list and the route (and whether it is a 404) for
// a request. A route's `head` says what its page is called, and `titleOf` (at the end of this file)
// is the one function a server and a browser both ask to name it.
//
// A route record may carry `load(juris)`: whatever must happen before the route can be drawn, which
// in practice is fetching the page's module and registering its components. With `register` beside
// it, `load()` answers the page's module (`() => import("./pages/x.js")`) and the router calls
// `register(module, juris)` itself, once per module on each instance: routes that share a module
// share its register, so it runs for whichever reaches it first, and a register that throws has its
// error thrown again to every later caller, so a half-registered module never looks loaded.
// navigate() and Back / Forward (popstate) await every matched record's load before the location is
// written, so the page being left stays up until the next one can draw, and an unregistered
// component is never rendered (RouterView would not draw it again once it registered: a blank page
// that stays blank). Each load runs once per router, which is once per instance; one that fails is
// tried again on the next navigation. A load that throws or rejects, register included, falls back
// to a full page load of the address: the router makes it the tab's entry, marked in history.state,
// and calls `fullLoad(url)` (a reload by default). An entry that already carries the mark is not
// loaded in full again, so a page whose code keeps failing cannot loop. A server loads every route's
// code up front with `loadAll()`.

// throws, or no data (a call that failed), never names a page: the route's own title is a fine
// answer. Whatever the app adds around it (a count, an environment's mark) is the app's.

// of an emoji, which the server writes as the replacement character and the browser keeps as a lone
// surrogate, so the two sides named the page differently.
