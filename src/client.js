// The client boot: what the browser entry of every server-rendered app does, in the one order that
// works. `hydrate(options)` makes a page the server rendered live, and answers the instance.
//
// The page arrives whole and readable. The server rendered its body into the root element (`#app`),
// wrote the state it rendered with as JSON beside it (`#state`) and, unless the app turned it off, the
// names of the services a browser may call (`#services`); once the page is idle, the document imports
// the app's entry module and calls its `start()` (src/server/document.js). A page kept in a cache
// boots whichever build serves it next, so those names and `start()` do not change between builds.
// `start()` calls this, and the order below is load-bearing:
//
//    1. parse the state
//    2. construct the instance, its services stubs that call the server's over HTTP
//    3. install the plugins: the router, the live client, then the app's own, in the order given
//       (the server installs them in the same order, since an api name is taken once)
//    4. register the app's components
//    5. the skew guard: when this build's route table names the page other than the server's did,
//       this is not the server's code, and it would draw the wrong page; so reload once, before
//       anything is drawn, and answer null
//    6. await the route's own code (every matched record's `load`), so nothing unregistered is drawn
//    7. beforeMount(juris): what the server could not know, such as a reader's preferences, set
//       before the first render reads the state
//    8. mount, replacing the server's markup (and releasing the preloaded calls)
//    9. bind the title
//   10. once the browser is idle, load every other route's code, so the first navigation is instant
//   11. register the service worker when idle, and hand its messages to the app
//   and last, expose the instance under a global name when asked (a test waits for it).
//
// Options:
//   routes                 the route table, as createRouter takes it (required)
//   router                 the router's own options beside its routes (createRouter's), above all
//                          `guard(to, ctx)`, who may open a route, and `context(api)`, the `ctx`
//                          navigate() asks it with: the server's router asks the same guard in its
//                          resolve(), with who is asking there
//   register(juris)        registers the app's components, the `root` one included
//   services               the names of the services a page may call; read from #services when
//                          omitted (none when the page has none)
//   apiBase = "/api"       where the server answers them: a call is a POST to `${apiBase}/<name>`
//   fallback               remoteServices' words for a failure whose answer carries none
//   live = true            the live client (sseClient) at the same base; an object is its options;
//                          false for none
//   plugins = []           the app's own plugins, installed after the router and the live client
//   beforeMount(juris)     step 7; may return a promise, which is awaited
//   title                  document.title, bound so it re-runs when what it reads changes; the
//                          server's title stays when omitted. `{ fallback, suffix, max, decorate }`,
//                          the options the server's kernel is given (decorate(text, juris) apart),
//                          names the page as the server did: the router's titleOf on the route's
//                          `head`, with its own data where the page keeps it (`head.dataPath`), so a
//                          page titled from its data keeps its name when it boots. A function,
//                          title(juris), answers the whole title itself
//   skewGuard              { storageKey, reload }, or false (the default). The guard has to remember,
//                          across the reload, that it has reloaded this page already, and it keeps
//                          that in sessionStorage under `storageKey`, a key the app names and lists
//                          among what it stores. `reload` is how, `location.reload()` unless given
//   prefetch = "idle"      "idle", or false to load a route's code only when it is visited
//   serviceWorker          a script URL, or { url, onMessage(data, juris, event) }: registered when
//                          the browser is idle, its messages handed to onMessage; none when omitted
//   expose                 a global name to put the instance under, once it is live
//   stateId = "state", rootId = "app", root = { App: {} }
//                          the page's elements, and the layout mounted into the root
//   juris                  the instance's own options, { allowTags, allowSchemes, allowInnerHTML }
//                          (juris.js sharedOptions): the tags and URL schemes both renderers draw
//                          beyond their defaults, and whether a layout may set innerHTML. The same
//                          object the server's kernel is given (createJurisServer's `juris`), from
//                          one module both import, or this boot takes away what the server drew.
//                          Nothing else: the state and the services are the boot's
// Those are all the options, and `title`, `skewGuard` and `serviceWorker` take only the keys named:
// any other, and a malformed value, is refused with a TypeError before the page is read. `router`,
// `live` and `juris` are refused as createRouter, sseClient and sharedOptions refuse them, before
// the page is read too.
//
// Nothing here writes browser storage but the skew guard, under the key the app gives it.
