// Client: remoteServices(names, { base, fallback, fetch }) returns { name: (...args) => Promise } stubs,
// one per name, each POSTing its JSON arguments to `${base}/${name}`. Handed to `new Juris({ services })`
// in the browser, so components calling api.call(name, ...args) reach the server's implementation of the
// same name. A refusal rejects with a ServiceError (./errors.js) carrying what the server answered.
//
// Live queries: sseClient({ base }) opens one Server-Sent Events stream, `${base}/events`, per Juris
// instance (installed with juris.use(sseClient({ base }))), registers and unregisters keys through
// `${base}/_live`, and writes each patch into the path the view chose. The browser reconnects the
// stream by itself; on every hello the client re-sends its subscriptions.
//
// The server half, serviceDispatcher, is Node code in ./server/service-dispatcher.js, which is never
// served, so no browser downloads it. It also says how the subscribers of one (name, args) share
// one subscription.

//                        of the event loop is over, so only a view re-made in the same turn keeps it
//   statePath = "$live"  where the connection is written: `.connected`, true from a hello until the
//                        stream is lost, and `.generation`, one more on every hello (absent before the
//                        first), so a component that watches it hears of every stream the server
//                        greets without polling; and `.reconnects`, one more on every hello that
//                        brings back a stream that was LOST (an error: the instance restarted, the

//                        `.paths.<live path>` (the path as one segment: src/state-manager.js
//                        pathSegment), each live path's `status` and, while it is "failed", its
//                        `message`: what api.liveState(path) and api.liveMessage(path) read (juris.js).
//                        "pending" from the subscribe until the first full answer ("live" at once when
//                        the preload's answer is on screen), "live" from then, "failed" when the

//                        (until the next answer), "offline" while the stream is down, "pending" again
//                        from the hello that brings it back until the new full. Gone once nothing is
//                        subscribed at the path. The data on screen is left as it was throughout: the
//                        status is what says whether it is current
//   onHello({ clientId, generation })      every hello: a stream is open, and the server named it
//   onReconnect({ clientId, generation })  every hello after the first: a stream came back, after an
//                        instance restarted, the network dropped, a refused stream was reopened, or
//                        the idle close had given the last one back (`.reconnects` is the narrower
//                        count, without the last)
//   onError(error, name, args)  a subscribe the server refused for a reason a new stream or a wait
//                        would not cure (not allowed, no such query): `error` is a ServiceError
//                        (./errors.js) with the answer's status, words and code. Without it, the
//                        console is told, as before. A stale client id (a new stream is opened) and a
//                        busy server (asked again after a wait) are not errors.
//   backoff = { minMs: 1000, maxMs: 30000 }  the wait before a refused stream is reopened, or a busy
//                        server asked again: minMs, doubling up to maxMs, and minMs again after a hello;

// reload), this plugin again or a new one; installing one while another is live is refused, as is

// Per Juris instance: where the live client installed now writes the connection, and whether it is
// live. The api is frozen and takes no name twice, so only an instance's first client adds
