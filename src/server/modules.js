//
//   const modules = await createModuleServer({ root, dev, build, mounts, assets, rootFiles, static, minify });

//   const href = await modules.versioned("/app/boot.js");  // for the page's own tags
//
// What is served is declared once, as mounts: `{ url, dir, depth, only }` serves the files in `dir`
// (relative to `root`) under the URL prefix `url`, down `depth` levels of subdirectories (0 unless
// told), with the extensions in `only` ([".js"] unless told, and only ".js", a module typed and
// import-stamped, or ".css", a stylesheet typed). Names are plain (letters, digits, `_`
// and `-`), so a URL can never walk out of its directory. `assets` are single files served the same
// way (a stylesheet, the browser entry). The framework's own browser half is always mounted, flat, at
// /src/: the top-level files beside this directory, and never a subdirectory of them, so the
// Node-only src/server/ is never served, whatever the mounts say. A mount, an asset, a root file or a
// static entry that reaches into src/ is refused at construction, by the file it names and not only
// by its URL, since an app that vendors the framework has it somewhere other than <root>/src. The
// paths compared are as written, not real paths: pass `root` as the real directory (a file: URL from
// the app's own import.meta.url is one), since through a symlink these refusals do not hold. From
// the mounts come what a URL may name, the boot snapshot, and which absolute imports are stamped, so
// the three cannot disagree.
//
// `rootFiles` are the files a browser finds by a fixed name and asks for again whenever it likes, such
// as a service worker and a web app manifest, which live at the root so that their scope is the whole
// site: `{ "/sw.js": { file: "web/sw.js", headers: { "service-worker-allowed": "/" } },
// "/manifest.webmanifest": "web/manifest.webmanifest" }`. They are not modules: sent as they are on
// disk (never stamped or minified), with no `?v` and no part in the code id, always `no-cache`, typed
// by extension unless `type` says, with any other headers the app gives them. They change what an
// installed app does, so production snapshots them too, and a declared one missing at start refuses
// construction.
//
// `static` is what a site serves that is not its code: fonts, pictures, a library vendored byte for
// byte. `{ url, dir, depth, only }` serves a directory's files with those extensions, as a mount
// does, and `{ url, file }` one file at one URL; either says how long a browser may keep it,
// `immutable: true` for a name that changes whenever the file does (a font's, a vendored folder
// that carries its version), or `maxAge` in seconds (0 unless told: asked again on every use).
// Names may carry dots (`chart-4.1.0/chart.js`) but start with a letter, a digit, `_` or `-`,
// so no name is `..`. A static file is sent as it is on disk, typed by its extension unless `type`
// says, never stamped or minified; text is gzipped for a browser that asks for it (and the answer
// varies by encoding), while a font or a picture is already compressed and goes one way. Its ETag
// names its bytes. Static files are not modules: no `?v`, no part in the code id, and not in the
// snapshot. Production reads each the first time it is asked for and keeps it, so an instance still
// on the old build may serve the new checkout's copy mid-roll, which a versioned name makes
// harmless; development reads the disk on every request. A declared name with no file behind it is
// a 404.
//
// Why each piece exists:
//
// - The snapshot. In production the served files are read ONCE, at construction. Every instance of
//   an app usually runs from one checkout, and a rolling deploy changes the files before it restarts
//   each instance; an instance still waiting its turn that read the files lazily would serve the new
//   code under its old URLs. It serves what it started with, and only that: a file the checkout
//   gained since is not found (404, `no-store`), because read from disk it would be the next build's
//   code with its imports stamped with this build's id, a module graph half of each. A page from
//   the next build that asks this instance for such a file cannot load it: it stays the readable
//   server-rendered page it is, and its next full load is one build's.
// - The code id. One hash of everything in the snapshot, plus the build, which the app passes, and
//   the transform this server applies (its stamper's and minifier's version, and whether and with
//   what it minifies). Module URLs carry it, so a URL changes exactly when the bytes served under it
//   can, and a rollback to the same code is the same URLs.
// - `versioned(path)`: the path with `?v=<content hash>-<code id>`, for the tags an app writes itself.
// - Import stamping. Every import a served module makes of another is rewritten to carry `?v=<code
//   id>`, so a browser never reuses a module it cached from another build. Relative specifiers and
//   absolute ones under a mount are stamped in every form a browser follows: `from` (imports and
//   re-exports), a side-effect `import "x"`, and `import(…)`. One form left unstamped is a second
//   URL for any module another form also reaches, so two module instances, two copies of every
//   module-level variable, and a "register once" guard that guards one of them (the symptom, when
//   a dynamic import of an absolute path was the form left out, was a component "already
//   registered" during hydration). A specifier that is not a string literal (or, as `import()`'s
//   argument, a template with no substitution) cannot be stamped, and a string, a comment or a
//   template's text that only spells an import is not code, and is left as it is.
// - `immutable` only for this process's own code id. Mid-roll, a page from an instance on the other
//   build can ask this one for a module under that build's URL. It gets an answer, but not one a
//   browser may keep for a year under a URL that names different code.
//
// In development (`dev: true`) nothing is snapshotted, minified or kept: every request reads the file
// from disk and stamps it again, so what a browser gets is what is on disk now, whether or not
// anything watches that file and whether or not a reload remembered to clear anything. A stack
// trace lands on a real line, and every answer is `no-store`. `clear()` forgets what production
// built from its snapshot, and has nothing to forget in development.
