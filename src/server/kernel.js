// The server kernel: what every server-rendered app on Juris does between a request arriving and a
// page going out, written once. Node only; it is never served. It holds three pieces: the page
// pipeline (`createPagePipeline`, first below), the lifecycle (the answers a server gives before any
// of the app's code, the 500, and the jobs it runs on a timer; `createLifecycle`), and the whole
// server that puts them together with the service dispatcher and the module server
// (`createJurisServer`, at the end of this file), which is what an app calls.
//
// createPagePipeline(options) → { render(url, viewer), handle(req, res, url), close() }
//
// `handle` answers a request for a page, always in this order, which is not configurable because it
// is what keeps a page from reaching someone it was not for:
//   1. the path's one spelling (canonicalPath): any other is a 301 to it, before anything reads it
//   2. who is asking (`viewer`), null for a guest
//   3. the route, as the router's resolve() names it for this request (who is asking is its
//      context): a location resolve answers, the router's guard's or the route table's own
//      redirect, sends the request there (302), before the cache is asked, so a copy kept for
//      guests is never served past a guard
//   4. the app's `before` hooks, in order: the first to answer a location redirects
//   5. the page cache, for guests only, and not for a guest's request the app's `personal` says is
//      theirs alone: a hit is sent, and a stale hit is sent while one render replaces it
//   6. the render, kept for the next guest when the cache allows it. A page the cache may keep is
//      rendered from its cache key, not from the address as asked: the key keeps only the query
//      parameters pages read, and a page rendered from the whole address would carry the first
//      visitor's other parameters in its state to every visitor it is served to. A viewer's page and
//      a personal one are rendered as asked and never kept
//   7. the answer: `public` for a guest, `private` for a viewer or a personal request, `no-store` in
//      development
// `render` is step 6 without the cache: the route's preload, one `renderRequest`, the status, the
// title and the document. It resolves the address it renders from itself, so the router's guard is
// asked again there: no render, a stale page's replacement included, is drawn past it. `close()`
// begins no more stale pages' replacements and resolves once those under way have finished.
//
// One Juris instance renders every request, and `renderRequest` keeps them apart by replacing the
// whole state (`clearState`) and serialising it (`serializeState`) with nothing in between that
// could yield. So every hook here runs before `renderRequest` is called (the preload list, the
// state) or after it returns (the title, the head). None may run inside it, and none does.

// `jobs` are the work an instance does on a timer: [{ name, every, run, atStart }], `every` a whole
// number of milliseconds up to 2^31 - 1 (about 24.8 days: the longest a Node timer keeps; a longer
// job runs more often and checks whether its time has come). `start()` starts them (a job marked
// `atStart` runs at once, too); a run that throws or rejects is reported as `onError(error, "job
// <name>")` and the job keeps its schedule. A job never runs beside itself: a tick that comes while
// its previous run is in flight is skipped, and `skipped` counts them, by job name. A job's
// timer never keeps the process alive by itself. `stop()` clears them and resolves once any run in
// flight has finished, so what the jobs use (a pool, a bus) can be closed after it. A job calls the
// app's own modules. One that calls an entry of its services hands it `internal(reason)`
// (../live-protocol.js): a service reads who is calling from its context, and a job is nobody's
// request, so it says it is the server's own call, of kind "internal", which vouches for no one.

// ---- the whole server -------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// createJurisServer(config) → Promise<{ listen, handle, render, close, codeId, juris, router }>
//
// The pieces above, with the service dispatcher and the module server, put together once, so that
// an app writes its routes, its components, its services and this one call, and no plumbing:
//
//   const app = await createJurisServer({ root, build, services, routes, setup, api, modules, page });
//   await app.listen({ port: 3000 });
//
// It builds the server's Juris instance (`isServer`, `requirePreload`: a call a render makes must
// have been preloaded, never run in the middle of it), installs the router made from `routes`, hands
// the instance to `setup` (awaited) to register the app's components and plugins, and then loads
// every route's code (the router's `loadAll`: each record's `load`, and its `register`, once per page
// module), so no render meets a route whose components are not registered yet. Then every
// request is answered in this order, which is not configurable, because it is what keeps each
// answer from reaching someone it was not for:
//   1–3. the lifecycle's: `x-instance` (when asked), the 400 for a target no URL can be made of,
//        `/version`, `/healthz`
//   4.   development only: /__reload, the reload stream (`devReload`)
//   5.   /api/: the service dispatcher (JSON calls only, a refusal's message shown only when it was
//        written for the caller, the live queries' event stream and subscriptions), or the handler
//        the app built in its place
//   6.   the app's own `handlers`, in order, for the routes it has beside its pages (uploads, say):
//        the first that answers ends the search
//   7.   the browser modules, the root files and the static files (the module server: the flat
//        /src/ always, never src/server/, and the app's mounts)
//   8.   /favicon.ico: 204, unless a root file answers it; /.well-known/: 404. Browsers and tools
//        ask for both by themselves, and neither is a page to render
//   9.   a page (the pipeline: the one spelling of its path, who is asking, the route and the
//        router's guard, the `before` hooks, the page cache for a guest, the render, the answer)
// Anything that throws is the lifecycle's fixed 500, with the error sent to `onError`.
//
// Every page carries the names of the services a browser may call (renderDocument's `#services`),
// so an app needs no module of its own to list them: by default the names the dispatcher answers to.
//
// `listen({ port = 0, host = "127.0.0.1" })` starts serving (once) and starts the jobs; it answers
// `{ port, host, url }`. It binds the loopback address unless told: a server reachable from the whole
// network is something an app asks for. `close()` drains, in this order, and answers the same
// promise however often it is called:
//   1. out of rotation: `/healthz` answers 503 on the connections still open
//   2. the live queries' event streams ended (the dispatcher's `close()`, or the app's handler's),
//      and development's reload streams (`devReload.close()`): each is a request that never ends by
//      itself, so the server's close would otherwise wait on it for the whole bound
//   3. the idle connections closed, and the requests in flight let finish, for at most
//      `closeTimeoutMs` (8000 unless told, below a 10 s forced exit), after which every connection
//      still open is cut
//   4. the jobs stopped, once any run in flight has finished, and the stale pages' replacements
//      under way finished (none begins from then on)
//   5. the app's `onShutdown` hooks, in order, each awaited: what the requests and the jobs used (a
//      change bus, a database pool), closed only once nothing is left to use it. A hook that fails
//      is reported as `onError(error, "shutdown")`, and the next still runs
// The entry decides when (a signal, say), since only it touches the Node process, and ends the
// process once `close()` has answered.
//
// config:
//   root            the app's directory (a path or a file: URL): mounts, assets and root files are

//   dev             development: nothing snapshotted or kept, every answer `no-store` (false unless
//                   told: an app maps its own environment onto it)
//   build           this deploy's name, a non-empty string, or a function answering it (asked on

//   router          the router's own options beside its routes (createRouter's), above all `guard(to,

//                   `viewer` hook says is asking, so the one function the browser's router asks
//                   decides on the server too. `context`, the browser's side of it, is taken and
//                   unused here
//   setup(juris)    registers the app's components and plugins on the server's instance, after the
//                   router is installed; awaited. Every route's own code (`load`, `register`) is
//                   loaded after it, by the kernel
//   layout          the root layout ({ App: {} } unless told)
//   juris           the instance's own options, { allowTags, allowSchemes } (juris.js sharedOptions):
//                   the tags and URL schemes both renderers draw beyond their defaults. The browser's
//                   boot is given the same object (hydrate's `juris`), from one module both import, or
//                   a page loses on boot what the server drew. Nothing else: the rest of the instance
//                   is the kernel's (isServer, requirePreload, services, exposeError)
//   exposeError(error)   whether a caller may read an error's message: in a service's answer and in
//                   a failed preload written into a page. `error.expose === true` unless told
//   api             the dispatcher's options (serviceDispatcher's: `live`, `context`, `expose`, …;
//                   `exposeError` and `onError` are the kernel's unless given), or a handler the app
//                   built, `(req, res, url) → boolean`, which is asked about every /api/ request,
//                   whose `names` say which services it answers to, and whose `close()`, when it has
//                   one, ends its streams when the server drains (a dispatcher's does)
//   handlers        the app's own routes beside its pages: [(req, res, url) → boolean], each asked

//                   `versioned(path)`, the module server's URL for a file it serves (a stylesheet)
//   cache           a page cache (page-cache.js), for guests' pages. Only beside a handler the app
//                   built: what evicts a kept page is the services' invalidations, which the app
//                   carries to the cache itself (its dispatcher's `live.onInvalidate`), and a
//                   dispatcher built here does not feed one, so its pages would be kept until they
//                   expired whatever changed
//   devReload       development's reload (dev-reload.js `devReload`, which the app makes, since only
//                   its entry can start the process that replaces this one): its stream is served,
//                   its client is written into every page, and it is ended when the server drains.
//                   Refused outside development
//   trustProxy      how many proxies stand in front (true, or { hops }): a dispatcher built here
