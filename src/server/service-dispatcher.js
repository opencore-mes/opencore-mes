// The service dispatcher: the server half of the shared services API, plus live queries. Node only:
// src/server/ is never served, so no browser downloads this file. The browser half, remoteServices
// and sseClient, is ../remote-services.js; what both ends compute (the call key, the diff) is
// ../live-protocol.js.
//
// serviceDispatcher(services, base, options) returns (req, res) => Promise<boolean> for Node's
// http module: it answers POST `${base}/${name}` by running services[name](...args) and returning the
// result as JSON (or { error } with a 4xx/5xx), and returns false for any other request so the caller
// can handle it. Rejections become { error: message } so the client stub rejects with the same message
// a preloaded { $error } would produce, with the fields a form puts beside its inputs when the
// service named any.
//
// Live queries (api.live in the core): a query the client keeps subscribed to.
//   - The client opens one Server-Sent Events stream, `${base}/events`, per Juris instance (installed with
//     juris.use(sseClient({ base }))), and registers/unregisters keys through `${base}/_live`.
//   - The server groups subscribers by `(name, args)` — the key the client computes (liveKey) encodes both —
//     so any number of clients watching the same query share one subscription: one DB call and one diff per
//     invalidation, not one per client. When a mutation that `touches` a query name runs (or invalidate(targets)
//     is called), every distinct subscribed query of that name is re-run once and diffed against its last
//     result; only the changed leaves travel, to every client watching it, and each client writes them into
//     the path it chose. An unchanged re-run sends nothing.
//   - On subscribe, a query with no subscribers yet is run once and its full value sent; joining a query
//     that already has subscribers is answered from the cached last value with no new DB call. The client
//     assigns leaf by leaf, so a value the page already has (from the transfer) wakes nothing.
//   - The browser reconnects the stream by itself; on every open the client re-sends its subscriptions.
//   - This sharing relies on identical (name, args) meaning identical, shareable data: unlike an ordinary
//     service call, a live query is never invoked with `this` bound to a request context (see options.context
//     below), so nothing session-specific can leak into a result shared this way by accident.

//   service), and a false result answers 403. Without it the only check is that the name is a live query,
//   which is right for public data and wrong for a query whose arguments name someone's private data.
//   It is also re-asked while the subscription lives, at most once per recheckMs per (client, query),
//   with { recheck: true } in `info` and the context captured at subscribe time as `this` — otherwise
//   losing access to something would not stop its patches (handler.invalidateAccess forces it sooner).
//   The per-caller ceilings bound one visitor rather than one client id, which costs nothing to mint:
//   clientKey says who a request is for that purpose, and an app behind a proxy must supply it (the
//   default is the socket address, which is the proxy for everyone).
//   bus carries invalidations between instances: publish(targets) is called for every local invalidation
//   whose targets are serializable, and subscribe(handler) feeds remote ones back in (applied without
//   being re-published). Groups and clients are per-process, so with more than one instance and no bus a
//   change reaches only the clients that happen to be connected to the instance that wrote it.
//   onInvalidate is told of every invalidation this instance applies, with or without a bus: a
//   mutation's `touches`, a flushAll service's ALL, handler.invalidate(targets), and what arrives off
//   the bus (`remote: true`). It is how anything else that holds data the targets name hears of it,
//   a page cache above all (`onInvalidate: (targets) => cache.invalidate(targets)`); it is called
//   before anything is awaited, so what it evicts is gone before this instance takes another
//   request. It sees every target, a function `where` included, and none for an empty list. A throw
//   or a rejection goes to onError ("live.onInvalidate") and stops nothing.
//   A `touches` entry is an array of targets, or a function (input..., result) => targets, sync or async, called with
//   the request context as `this`, the service's arguments, and its result. A target (in `touches`, and in
//   handler.invalidate(targets)) says which groups re-run:
//     "name", or { name }           every group of that query
//     { name, args: [7] }           the groups whose arguments match position by position, compared as strings;
//                                   a group's arguments past the array's end are not compared (so `args: []`
//                                   is every group of that name). `undefined` in a slot matches anything, but
//                                   on this instance only: a bus carries targets as JSON, which writes it as
//                                   null, and another instance then matches only a null argument there
//     { name, where: { a: 1 } }     the groups whose FIRST argument is an object with those fields, compared as
//                                   strings
//     { name, where: (args) => … }  the groups the function accepts, given their whole argument list
//   Every form but the last is data, so it crosses a bus to the other instances; a function is applied on this
//   instance only (bus stats count it as unpublishable). So a message in chat 7 re-runs the groups watching
//   chat 7, not every open chat on the server.
//   retryMs is how long a browser that lost the event stream waits before it opens it again (the SSE
//   `retry:` field, sent first on every stream): 2000 unless said, a whole number of milliseconds of at
//   least 1 (0 would reopen a failing stream in a tight loop), or construction throws. A fleet whose instances take longer to come back may want more.
//   Only live queries may be subscribed to. Anything else (a mutation above all) is refused with 403 and
//   `code: "live.not-a-query"`, before `authorize` is asked, since a subscription runs the service with no
//   request context and re-runs it on every invalidation. Which names are live queries:
//     strictQueries: true   the names in `queries`, and nothing else. A `touches` target is an
//                           invalidation name only: onInvalidate (a page cache) hears it, and it re-runs
//                           groups only when it is also a declared query, so naming a read in a
//                           mutation's list does not make it subscribable. An app whose touches name
//                           a read that is no query should say this.
//     by default            the names in `queries` plus every name an array-valued `touches` entry lists,
//                           as it always has been. Such a name is subscribable whenever `authorize` lets
//                           it be, and an app's rule table with no row for an ordinary read that a
//                           mutation happens to refresh is then all that keeps it from being a query.
//   Either way a direct POST asks `authorize` about a declared query alone: a touches target is an
//   ordinary service there, which no rule was written for.
// options.maxBody: largest request body in bytes (default 1 MB); larger bodies get 413.
//   Every POST must be sent as application/json (else 415): a cross-site <form> cannot send that type
//   without a CORS preflight, so a cookie-authenticated service cannot be triggered from another site.
// options.context: (req, res) => ctx — services are invoked as services[name].call(ctx, ...args), so a
//   service that needs the request (cookies, the session, the client's address) reads `this`. Every
//   context a request builds is marked as a direct call (CALL_KIND, ../live-protocol.js), whatever it
//   says about itself: an object the app built is marked in place (own and unfrozen) or behind a
//   wrapper that inherits its fields; with no context, or one that returns nothing, the dispatcher
//   hands the request its own, which is only the mark. So a request never reaches a service, or
//   `authorize`, `identify` or a `touches` function, looking like the server's own call. Live
//   queries are the exception: they are re-run as the live layer's own call, with a frozen context
//   of kind "live" that names nobody, because their result is shared across every client subscribed
//   to the same (name, args) — see the live-queries note above.
//   The context built for a subscribe is KEPT (client.ctx), and every re-check of that subscription (before a
//   patch, at most once per recheckMs, and on handler.invalidateAccess) hands it to `authorize` again, long
//   after its response was sent.
//   So an app's context must hold what identifies the caller (a session token, an address) and nothing that
//   answers for it: a viewer resolved once and memoised on the context would pass every re-check, and a
//   session signed out would keep its patches. And it must not close over the response: by a re-check the
//   response has ended (a header written through it then throws, and the re-check counts as a refusal), and
//   the kept context keeps that response, and its request, in memory for as long as the subscription lives.
//   Subscriptions are bounded: a client that has no event stream is dropped after graceMs like one whose
//   stream closed, a client may hold at most maxKeysPerClient keys (429 beyond), the server at most maxGroups
//   distinct queries (503 beyond), and a key must be the query's own `name:JSON(args)` (400 otherwise), so one
//   query cannot be registered many times under different keys.
// options.expose: the service names this dispatcher will answer to. Without it, every own function on
//   `services` at construction time is an endpoint — so an object that also carries internal helpers
//   publishes them. Either way the list is fixed at construction, not looked up per request. Two
//   names are the live layer's endpoints, `events` and `_live`, and construction throws if a service
//   it would answer to has one, whether or not live queries are on.
// options.strict: { names, flushAll, warn } — opt in to having every service say what it changes.
//   Construction throws, listing every problem, if `names` (the list the app gives its browsers, one
//   stub per name) and the services this dispatcher answers to differ either way; if a name in
//   live.queries, a live.touches key or target, or flushAll is not a service; or if a service is
//   none of a declared live query, a live.touches key ([] says "changes nothing a page shows") or a
//   member of flushAll. "Say nothing, so flush everything" was once a default, and it emptied a page
//   cache on every read. flushAll names the services whose success changes what any page may show:
//   each also invalidates ALL (above) once it succeeds, as `touches: ALL` would. warn(message, names)
//   is told, once and at construction, the declared live queries that no touches list names, whose
//   subscribers never see a change: meant or not, that is the app's to decide.
// options.forms: { allow, maxBody = 16384, redirect(name, outcome) } — the no-JavaScript path: a
//   plain <form method="post" action="${base}/<name>"> sends its fields form-encoded, which a service
//   otherwise refuses (415, above). For a name in `allow`, and only then, a form-encoded POST is
//   answered here, and what stands in for the JSON-only rule is: the Origin (or, when a browser sends
//   none, the Referer) names the host the request was sent to, else 403 with nothing run; the body is
//   at most maxBody bytes, else 413; the fields, as one object, are the service's one argument, run
//   through invoke (below) with the request's context, so authorize, the touches and the error filter
//   are the JSON call's. The answer is a 303 to redirect(name, { ok, status, message, fields?,
//   result?, req }): `message` is the refusal's words when exposeError lets the caller read them, and
//   null otherwise (a driver's words go to onError, and the app says what to show instead); it must
//   answer a path on this site ("/…", as the browser's URL parser reads it: see onThisSite), or the
//   request fails rather than send a browser elsewhere.
//   Construction throws without a redirect, or for a name in `allow` that is not a service.
// handler.invoke(name, args, ctx): one call through the whole pipeline, for any transport other than
//   the JSON POST (the form path above, a job, a test): authorize for a declared live query (with
//   `ctx` as `this`), the service (as `ctx`), its touches once it succeeds, and the error filter. It
//   answers { ok: true, result } or { ok: false, status, error, fields?, field?, code? }, what a JSON
//   caller would read. `ctx` is taken as given: one that says no kind is a direct call (callKind).
// options.exposeError: (error) => boolean — whether the caller may read this error's message. The
//   default is `error.expose === true`, i.e. nothing unless a service says so (a ServiceError, from
//   ../errors.js, does): a driver's message names tables and columns, and it used to travel to the
//   browser as-is. Everything hidden this way is handed to onError instead, so nothing is lost, only
//   redirected. A refusal answers { error, fields?, field?, code? }: see the catch in the handler.
// options.onError: (error, queryName, args) => void — called when a live query fails to re-run (the client is
//   told too, and logs it); without it the failure is only visible in the browser console.
// Those are all the options, and live, strict and forms take only the keys named above (OPTIONS):
// any other, at the top or inside one of the three, is refused at construction with a TypeError, as
