// The same change bus as ./mysql-outbox.js, on PostgreSQL instead of MariaDB.
//
// The difference that matters: Postgres has LISTEN/NOTIFY, so an instance is woken by the database the
// moment a change commits instead of discovering it on its next poll. MariaDB has no equivalent, which
// is why its feeder polls at a fixed interval and pays that interval in latency and in query load.
//
// NOTIFY alone is not enough, though, and a bus built on it alone drops changes:
//   - a notification is delivered only to sessions listening AT THAT MOMENT, so anything published while
//     an instance is restarting, failing over or reconnecting is gone;
//   - it is not persisted and cannot be replayed.
// So this keeps the outbox table as the source of truth and uses NOTIFY purely as a doorbell: the
// listener wakes, reads the table, and a slow sweep runs anyway to catch whatever the doorbell missed.
//
// Usage:
//   await pool.query(SCHEMA);                     // or schemaFor({ table, channel }), once, at migration
//   const bus = createPgOutboxBus({ pool, targets: { chat: (id) => ({ name: "chat", args: [id] }) } });
//   const handler = serviceDispatcher(services, "/api", { live: { queries, touches, bus } });
//   await bus.start();
//   setInterval(() => bus.prune().catch(report), 10 * 60_000).unref();   // the table is not history
