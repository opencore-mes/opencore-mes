// Development reload: a development server that restarts itself when code it runs changes, and
// reloads the pages open on it when only what browsers load changed.
//
//   const reload = devReload({
//       root,                                  // the app's directory (a path or a file: URL)
//       restartOn: ["server", "app.mjs"],      // code the server runs, relative to root
//       reloadOn: ["client/theme.css"],        // what only browsers load
//       onRestart: (file) => { … },            // replace this process (required)
//       onReload: (file, { clients }) => { … },// forget what was built from the old files (optional)
//   });
//   renderDocument(page, { …, devReload: reload.script });   // the client, at the end of the body
//   if (reload.handle(req, res, url)) return;                // true when it answered /__reload
//   reload.close();                                          // on shutdown
//
// Why each piece exists:
//
// - Restarting, not re-importing. A server loads its code once, and Node has no honest way to load
//   a module again, so the one reload that gives a server its new code is a new process. The
//   framework cannot start one itself (it never touches `process`: only an app's entry does), so
//   `onRestart(file)` is the app's: it starts the successor and lets this process go. It is called
//   once. Whatever this process hears after it is ignored, since it is on its way out.
// - What restarts. Everything under the framework's own directory (this file's parent, `src/`),
//   always, and whatever `restartOn` names. A directory is watched recursively, so a folder made
//   inside it later is covered the moment it exists (`src/server/` was missed exactly that way by
//   a list of directories); a file is watched through its directory, filtered by name, since
//   editors often save by writing a copy and renaming it over the file, and a watch on the file
//   itself follows the replaced file and hears nothing after the first such save. A watched path
//   that does not exist, or is outside `root`, is refused when this is made.
// - What only reloads. `reloadOn` names files browsers load that the server does not run: a
//   stylesheet, the browser entry. `onReload(file, { clients })` runs first, so the app can move
//   its build id and drop what it rendered, and then every open page is told to reload.
// - One decision per burst. A checkout or a formatter writes several files at once, so changes are
//   gathered until 150 ms pass without one. A burst that touched anything a restart covers restarts,
//   whatever else it touched and in whatever order: a restart reloads the pages too, and a reload
//   would leave the server running the old code.
// - A watcher that fails counts as a change to what it watched. It can no longer say what changed,
//   so the server does what such a change would have made it do; a restart watches everything again.
// - The page's side. `script` is the client, which `renderDocument` writes at the end of the body.
//   It listens at `/__reload` (the path is fixed: pages already open know it) and reloads the page on
//   an explicit `reload` event, or when the `build` event it hears on connecting names another
//   process than the one it heard first. That is how a restart reaches the page: the stream drops,
//   the browser tries again every second, and the process that answers is a new one. Each
//   reloader names its own process with a random id, never the app's build: an app that pins its
//   build (from its environment, say) keeps it across a restart, and the page would not reload.
